# NYU Shuttle App

## Project Description

The NYU Shuttle App is a mobile application designed to provide real-time information about the NYU shuttle bus service. It is a convenient tool for NYU students, faculty, and staff to track shuttle bus locations, plan routes, and receive updates on shuttle schedules. The primary goal of this project is to enhance the overall commuting experience for the NYU community by making transportation more efficient and accessible.

## Product Vision Statement
Recognizing the limitations in NYU's existing shuttle app, primarily concerning its user interface, we want to create a better mobile-friendly application with shuttle information that is easy to access and understand.
